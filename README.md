# The Sublimest Trail Finder
> “He loved the soothing hour, when the last tints of light die away; when the stars, one by one, tremble through æther, and are reflected on the dark mirror of the waters; that hour, which, of all others, inspires the mind with pensive tenderness, and often elevates it to sublime contemplation.” 
― Ann Radcliffe, The Mysteries of Udolpho

**The Sublimest** was created with love for hiking and the Romantic idea of [the Sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(literary)), to help us find experiences that take us outside of ourselves. 

Using the [Hiking Project API](https://www.hikingproject.com/data), The Sublimest helps users search for hiking trails nearby and leave reviews about them. 
## As of December 2020, The Hiking Project API has been closed from public use. This project no longer works as designed as the API access has been severed.

### Icebox 
* I want to add the ability for users to edit their reviews. 
* I'd like to fix my history and browser back button issues -- if a user hits the back button in their browser, it resets the data. I tried implementing useHistory with hooks, but had issues. 
* I want to add Geolocation for users who want to use it. 
* Add Google Maps to the details page. 
* Create the ability for users to save their hikes.
